# Kent's Game
Hi there I just wanted to learn javascript so I made a simple game and decided to share it so you can play if you have fun for a short time thank you.
# Tutorial
Its arrow keys to move around and your goal is to dodge the enemies and survive as long as possible everytime you get 5 points they spawn faster however the limit is 0.08 spawns a second it doesn't get smaller you are the blue player and the enemies are red. 1 point = 1 second survived you also have one
life and because it's my first game I dont know how to make my own restart or high score or leaderboard so very simple.
# I likely won't contribute to this project
This is because it was a very simple game and just a starter because I enjoy making games my real starter was of course the Hello World thing so I did console.log("Hello World") I didn't code the HTML or CSS but I did code the javascript an AI coded the html and css because I was focused on learning
javascript and not anything else.
